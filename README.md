# Survival of the Fastest: Enabling More Out-of-Order Execution in Dataflow Circuits
This repository holds the source code, benchmarks and results of the work presented in the "Survival of the Fastest: Enabling More Out-of-Order Execution in Dataflow Circuits" paper, which allows for new levels of out-of-order execution, not achievable by prior work, in dataflow circuits.

# Prerequisites
1) We prepared a virtual machine (VM) containing an installation of the Dynamatic tool, that we implemented our technique within, with its dependencies. It also contains an installation of Modelsim 20.1 which we use to get the cycles count. The VM is available through the following link [TO ADD]
2) Vivado 2019.2
